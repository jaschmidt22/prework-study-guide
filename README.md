## Description

I created this Prework Study Guide for boot camp students, like myself, who are completing the Prework. There is alot of information to learn in the boot camp prework, which can be overwhelming. I decicded to make this study guide to outline some of the important information on the main topics. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. In making this study guide, it has helped to reinforce the information that I learned in the prework. I can now understand how HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript are each an itegral part of creating a webpage, and how they all work together to create a finished product.

## Usage

Each section of the Prework Study Guide contains notes about each of the main topics covered in the bootcamp prework. To see the JavaScript in action, the DevTools console can be opened. It will show you suggestions on what you can study first. I hope this study guide is as helpful for you, as it was fun for me to make!
